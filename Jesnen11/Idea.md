He is from a universe that learns and only learns

He senses that someone is reading him.

It's like an itch but he can't quite get to that person. 

He ends up breaching a similar universe to the one that he is actually trying to get to and meets the reader. 

He befriends the reader in an immaterial form, he shows him all the visuals and whatnot

Tie this into the statistics story


"I can't breach it, it's a one way universe"

"This is a two way"
