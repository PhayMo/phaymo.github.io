>Jesnen, we have read the report from your father, why did you not come sooner?

<I could not think of the word to describe what I was feeling and I had not thought a memory countermand was necessary yet.

>Memory countermands are conducted for duplicate or unnecessary knowledge for all those in the Sanctum, they give clearer pathways to sharing all knowledge. Given that is everything is already known we are working to retire this procedure. We are not going through with a memory countermand for you.

<Than what shall I do with this feeling.

>We are going to send you to the universe from where your feeling is coming from, Jesnen. We are ready to move past the Sanctum. You are the first to come with this feeling, if there are others than they will be sent as well. It seems your feeling might be a calling card to expand our knowledge outside of the Sanctum.
