< So what book are you going to pick?
> I don't know.
>Summer reading is stupid. If we read in the Summer than we shouldn't have to read during the semester.
<That makes no sense.
>Scratch that, it should be that you get to swap your reading so if you don't read in the Summer than you don't have to read in the Fall.
<That also makes no sense.
>Do you ever agree with me?
< We both liked that movie we went to last week.
<...Actually that's not true, I agreed with you so that we could go to the arcade later in that 
> That's messed up.
< I think I'm going to pick this one. 'The Alchemist.' I think Jasmine picked this one too
>Wow, picking the shortest book and copying Jasmine.
<I'll have something to talk with her about.
> Yeah, you can talk about all
