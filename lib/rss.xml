 <br>FarnenJesnen, what ails you?JesnenFather, I am not exactly sure how to put this specific feeling into words.FarnenHow many words have I taught you? How many words has the Sanctum taught you? You are disrespecting the Sanctum if you cannot learn through this.JesnenI will try. I did not intend to disrespect you or the Sanctum. 'Scopaesthesia' seems to be a word in the proper direction but it is not right.FarnenSon, who is watching you? Is someone causing your ailment.JesnenNo, it feels like I am being watched but it is not of this universe.JesnenI'm not certain.FarnenSon, we know everything of this universe. If someone or something was watching you, the Sanctum would be the first to know. This is all in your head. Visiting other universes is strictly prohibited. We know none of the information that sits within them.FarnenVisit the Sanctum Crest. I'm reporting this and requesting a memory countermand for you.JesnenOkay Father, I will go now.]]></description><link>Jesnen11/Story/Jesnen/Scene 1.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Jesnen11/Story/Jesnen/Scene 1.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 21:39:06 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
